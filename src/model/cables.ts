// The cable model (nested-tracks.md §19): a label links exactly one
// `sends:` entry to exactly one `- receive:` entry, and everything a
// cable means is derived from where its two ends sit in the containment
// graph. This module owns that derivation — the 1:1 and dangling checks,
// the zero-displacement rule on the receive's path, the combined-graph
// cycle check, and the arrival walk — so `check` and the build graph
// cannot answer "when does this signal arrive" differently.
//
// Arrivals are derived, not invented (§19 decision 5), and "the common
// ancestor" is really every join on the receiver's way up: a return
// carrying its own dry copy of the sender hears it at zero *and* again
// through the mix above (#125 review), so the walk climbs from the
// receiver collecting, at each track, the sender placements in that
// track's subtree — excluding the subtree it just climbed out of, whose
// senders every instance already heard from inside: an instance hears
// itself, not its siblings, which is the placed-ancestor coherence §19
// states. Displacement on an up edge is legal exactly when nothing
// joins above it (the circuit shifts as one, decision 4's rule seen
// from the other side), and where the receiver has several parents
// their views must agree, because arrivals bake into a render that
// exists once however often the track is placed (§13). Both walks are
// memoized per track, so the cost is the graph's size, not the number
// of paths through it.

// One landing of the sender's signal on the receiver's timeline, in
// receiver-rate samples. `count` is how many identical placements land
// there together: two placements of the sender at one position sum to
// twice the amplitude, which one clip at +20·log₁₀(count) dB renders
// exactly — and holding the count instead of repeating the arrival is
// what keeps a mix full of shared containments (every level of sharing
// multiplies the soundings) from expanding into millions of rows.
