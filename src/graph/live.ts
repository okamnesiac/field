// Compile the graph into a live session (realtime.md §3, chunk 2).
//
// The graph's track nodes already carry each track's full StemSpec —
// resolved clips at the track's rate, sources as ordered refs matching
// node.deps — so the compiler transforms those specs instead of
// re-planning. Sources classify three ways by their dep label: a
// `track:` ref becomes a `track` window (the child's live output ring
// read at a delay — a post-tap cable arrival is mechanically the same
// thing and compiles to the same shape); a `tap:` ref becomes a
// `receive` window reading the sender's pre-chain ring; everything else
// is a `file` window naming the built or committed path, which is why
// the compiler builds every non-track dependency first.
//
// Latency is compiler arithmetic, never engine arithmetic (playback.md
// §3.6's division of labour): the limiter's live horizon is one attack
// ramp (60 dB — session.ts records the choice), eq and reverb are
// zero, a materialized cross-rate edge is delay-free (realtime.md
// decision 7's amendment: the wrapper's emission is timeline-aligned),
// and each summing input carries comp_delay = maxSibling − own so
// unequal paths arrive aligned. The engine only applies offsets.
//
// Durations resolve analytically, bottom-up: a file window from its WAV
// header (execute()'s own rule, frames − read_offset), a track window
// from the child's computed live length — content end plus each
// reverb's predelay and tail, truncated to the declared extent on the
// song's output. A window whose start − read_offset is negative would
// need future child samples; live taps only ever delay, so that is a
// compile error.
//
// The cache is the freeze (realtime.md decision 4, chunk 4): before
// compiling, every non-output, non-pre-tapped track asks the build
// cache — explain(), which executes nothing — whether its stem action
// is cached. A cached track compiles to one file window over its stem;
// the rest evaluate live and are reported as `dirty`, so the watch loop
// can rebuild their stems behind the play and freeze them on the next
// compile — a swap that is inaudible because live and offline are
// bit-identical (decision 3). CPU scales with what is being edited,
// not with the session.
