// The live session engine (realtime.md §3, chunk 2): evaluates the
// compiled graph the CLI sends — tracks, windows, chains — sample-exactly
// against the offline render, which is the golden-equivalence claim
// --render-live exists to prove.
//
// Evaluation is just-in-time offline rendering rather than a causal
// stream: every source is a committed or built file, so the future
// always exists, and a track's chain (whose limiter wants lookahead) is
// satisfied by producing children slightly ahead of the playback clock.
// Rings are therefore timeline-aligned full buffers — track lengths are
// compiler-computed and finite — and the compiler's comp_delay fields
// stay zero in practice until recording introduces a source whose future
// does not exist yet. Memory over machinery, deliberately: creek is
// ~7 MB of track buffers, the freeze chunk replaces most of them with
// cached stem files, and a streaming ring is an optimization this
// design leaves room for rather than a correctness requirement.
//
// The window arithmetic is mixdown.cpp's sumClips per sample, in clip
// order — same accumulation, same float roundings, same fades and
// balance law — and the loop fold on the output track replicates
// applyDeclaredLength's addition order, computed on read. Chains are the
// chunk-1 streaming classes, so block partitioning cannot move a bit.
