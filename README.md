# Field

Field is a Mac-first, Git-native music production system designed so
entire music projects are operable by both humans and coding agents. A
song is a repository: every piece of production state — arrangement,
tempo, takes, effect chains, synthesis programs, generation recipes,
mixes — is schema-validated YAML, every meaningful action is a CLI
command, and audio is produced by an explicit dependency graph with
content-addressed caching.

The closest analogy: **Bazel for music production**, growing toward a
real-time recording runtime and an agent-native control layer.

## What that looks like

A track is a YAML file. This one plays a generated electric-piano
phrase and sends it to a shared reverb:

```yaml
# songs/creek/tracks/keys.yaml (abridged)
name: keys
sends:
  keys-verb:
    gain_db: -14
inputs:
  - track: still-water-keys
    at: [1]
    duration: [4]
```

The song's structure is tracks placing tracks — creek is three passes
of a four-bar phrase, and the file says so:

```yaml
# songs/creek/tracks/main.yaml (abridged)
name: main
inputs:
  - track: phrase
    at: [1]
  - track: phrase
    at: [5]
  - track: phrase
    at: [9]
```

Everything is buildable, and everything explains itself. The reverb
return hears the keys once per pass — Field derives the arrival times
from the tree, and refuses wirings where they would be ambiguous:

```console
$ field explain creek/track:space
...
reaches: track:main -3.0 dB
cable: receive "keys-verb" ← track:keys, -14.0 dB (tap post), 3 arrivals at samples 0, 480000, 960000
cable: receive "vocal-verb" ← track:lead-vocal, -10.0 dB (tap post), arrives at sample 0
```

Edits rebuild exactly what they change. Nudge that send from `-14` to
`-13` and `field build creek` re-renders `space` and `main` — every
other stem is a cache hit, and the sender never re-renders. A fader
move re-runs one sum. A comment edit rebuilds nothing. Freezing *is*
caching: there is no separate freeze machinery to manage.

Generation is a committed recipe, not a lost session. A seeded
SuperCollider program rebuilds bit-for-bit under the same SuperCollider
toolchain (the program's content hash is a cache input; your sclang
install is not); a model request (ACE-Step music, Chatterbox voice)
records its takes with full provenance — model, seed, hash — and
`field choose` repoints which take the song plays by moving one line in
that record. In a project that commits its generated audio, that is a
one-line Git diff — bloom deliberately doesn't: the recipes ship, and
every clone generates its own takes:

```console
$ field generate creek/still-water-keys --seed 90210 --variants 2
$ field choose creek/still-water-keys --variant 2
$ field play creek
```

And because it is all text, `git diff` is the session history, `git
revert` undoes a mix decision, and a coding agent can read, edit,
build, and audition a project with no DAW in the loop.

## Try it

Node 24 (the version in [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc)), pnpm — never npm or
yarn — and [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/): every
render in the example project is an SC recipe, and `field build` runs
`sclang` from your PATH, the macOS app bundle, or `FIELD_SCLANG`:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm add -g .        # links `field` onto your PATH (needs `pnpm setup` once)
pnpm build:native    # field-audiod, the playback and render daemon
```

`pnpm add -g .` links this checkout rather than copying it, so a later
`pnpm build` takes effect with no re-linking, and `field` works from
any directory. To run from source without installing: `pnpm field
<args>`. To remove: `pnpm remove -g field`.

Then open the example project — two songs that exercise most of the
system, checked by CI on every change:

```sh
cd examples/bloom
field check                                            # validates everything
field build tall-grass && field play tall-grass        # SC recipes only, no models needed
field generate creek/still-water-keys --seed 90210 --variants 2
field generate creek/lead-take --seed 4823 --variants 3
field build creek && field play creek                  # the full song
field arrangement creek                                # the derived timeline
```

The two `generate` steps need the model workers (`field setup aced`,
`field setup voiced` — explicit, never automatic); everything else runs
from SuperCollider recipes alone. See the
[bloom README](examples/bloom/README.md) for the guided tour.

### The audio daemon

`field-audiod` is a separate native binary (CMake and JUCE), built by
`pnpm build:native`. Build it before playing **or building** anything:
the daemon is also the renderer — `eq`, `limit` and `reverb` targets
render by spawning it, so `field build` fails without it rather than
falling back to anything.

Without it `field play` falls back to `afplay`, `field devices` fails,
and the options that need a real-time transport — `--from`, `--device`,
`--loop`, `--click`, `--watch` — refuse to run rather than pretending.

The CLI looks for the binary inside the checkout it was linked from, so
one build serves every project directory. `FIELD_AUDIOD` overrides that
path. It builds on macOS and Linux, and CI builds it on both.

### Playing the keyboard

`field keys` turns the computer keyboard into the MIDI source `Field
Keys`, which Logic or any other MIDI application can play from. It
needs `field-audiod` and a terminal that reports key releases through
the kitty keyboard protocol: Ghostty, iTerm2 3.5 or later, kitty, or
WezTerm. Keys are read by physical position, so Dvorak, AZERTY, and
other layouts play the same notes, and a keymap of your own is a YAML
file away. Name an instrument, as in `field keys pad` inside
`examples/bloom`, and it plays that SuperCollider instrument live too.
See [docs/keys.md](docs/keys.md).

## Status

The offline half is real and in daily use: nested tracks, per-track
tempo/meter and sample rates with automatic edge conversion, sends with
derived arrivals, seeded SuperCollider rendering, deliberate music and
voice generation, watch mode with live variant A/B-ing, versioned
export, and a native playback daemon with a sample-accurate transport.

Recording, monitoring, and plugin hosting are next — the real-time
engine's settled decisions are in
[docs/audio-engine.md](docs/audio-engine.md), and the current build
order is in [docs/projects/](docs/projects/README.md). An MCP surface
exposing the CLI's verbs to agents is planned.
